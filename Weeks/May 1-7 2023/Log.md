Day 1
-------------------------
Currently stoked to get started!

I'll be using my good friend Drew's minesweeper clone as a baseline for logic and project structure. It can be found at https://github.com/Doct0rLekter/minesweeper
(he goes highly in detail about his thought process while building it! You may find some insightful information in the README)

Today, I set up the project and implemented board generation (just the data).
